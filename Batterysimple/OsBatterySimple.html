    <h1 class="red-heading">What you can do with the experiments in this library?</h1>
    <p>In this library, you will find a set of experiments that are frequently used and widespread in the field of cognitive neuroscience. Under the relevant categories, such as Memory, Attention, etc., you will see various experiments. If you wish, you can run these experiments through a browser or download them to your computer and run them with OpenSesame.</p>

    <h2>Memory</h2>
    <h3>N-Back Paradigm</h3>
    <p>The N-back task has been widely used to assess Working Memory (WM) functions. "N" is a variable that refers to a level at which participants are asked to decide whether the presented stimuli are the same as "n" previous stimuli. The most common "n" levels are n=1, n=2, n=3, and n=0 (control condition).</p>
    <p>In a typical N-2 Back task, participants are presented with a series of stimuli one-by-one (strings, images, or sounds). Their task is to decide whether the presented stimulus is the same as the one presented two times before (N-2). If it is, a response would be a keypress. Otherwise, they should not respond. The correct response would be a key press if the stimulus is the same, and the false alarm would be a key press to different stimuli (Figure 2).</p>
    <p>The task requires sustained performance rather than individual responses throughout the trial and this ensures that working memory is “on-line” during the task.</p>
